            If you registered as an individual and do not have a team yet, donâ€™t sweat it. There
            will be several online events and channels geared towards facilitating team formation

          <svelte:fragment slot="content">
            Each team consists of a maximum of four members. You can create a team and designate
            teammates during registration, or you can register as an individual. All teammates must
            submit individual applications. Admission decisions will be all-or-none, so either all
            of your teammates will receive admission or none of your teammates will receive
            admission.
