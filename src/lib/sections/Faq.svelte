            <svelte:fragment slot="content">
              Each team consists of a maximum of four members. You can create a team and designate
              teammates during registration, or you can register as an individual. All teammates
              must submit individual applications. Admission decisions will be all-or-none, so
              either all of your teammates will receive admission or none of your teammates will
              receive admission.
