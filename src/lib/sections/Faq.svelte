      <h1 class="mt-3 text-blue-700">What if I don't have a team?</h1>
      <p>
        If you registered as an individual and do not have a team yet, donâ€™t sweat it. There will be
        several online events and channels geared towards facilitating team formation and project
        ideation. We will help you find people to work with!
      </p>
      <h1 class="mt-3 text-blue-700">How do teams work?</h1>
      <p>
        Each team consists of a maximum of four members. You can create a team and designate
        teammates during registration, or you can register as an individual. All teammates must
        submit individual applications. Admission decisions will be all-or-none, so either all of
        your teammates will receive admission or none of your teammates will receive admission.
