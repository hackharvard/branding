          What if I don't have a team?
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you registered as an individual and do not have a team yet, donâ€™t sweat it. There will
          be several online events and channels geared towards facilitating team formation and
          project ideation. We will help you find people to work with!
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-3 font-bold text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-200">How do teams work?</h4>
        <p>
          Each team consists of a maximum of four members. You can create a team and designate
          teammates during registration, or you can register as an individual. All teammates must
          submit individual applications. Admission decisions will be all-or-none, so either all of
          your teammates will receive admission or none of your teammates will receive admission.
